# 2fa-auth-with-authy
A simplistic example using Node with Authy for a basic 2FA example.

This is pretty basic as I am new to Node, Express, Jade and Authy. This is just experimentation code and in no way of production quality.

**Installation:**

1. Download the project with your favorite IDE.
2. Run: npm install (this will download and install all the required modules in package.json)
3. Run the www startup script in the bin folder. This will start up the Express web server.
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000.

**To Do:**

1. Upgrade to Pug from Jade (Jade is now known as Pug and need to include that to get the latest version). This version is depcrecated
2. Upgrade to jstransformer from transformer (transformer has now been deprecated).
